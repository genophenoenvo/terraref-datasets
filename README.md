For **GenoPhenoEnvo** collaborators: if you already have a [CyVerse](https://cyverse.org/) account, please follow these instructions to access the **reproducible data cleaning apps** for MAC Sorghum Seasons 4 and 6 and Kansas Sorghum Experiments. These apps and associated input data have not yet been made public. If you do not have app access, please make sure that you have a CyVerse account and send me your username via Slack or [e-mail](mailto:ejcain@arizona.edu).

#### Instructions for running CyVerse VICE Data Cleaning Apps

- Select `Create Quick Launch`
- From the window that pops up, select `Launch Analysis` in the lower right corner
- Once the analysis has been launched, a notification will appear in the top right corner, where you will be able to select `Access your running analysis here`.
- Wait. . . (could take several minutes to load)
- A Jupyter Notebook Launch window should open in your browser. The file panel on the left will show the data cleaning notebooks and input .csv files used in the notebooks.
- Double-click on the notebook you wish to run
- Select `Run` and then `Run All Cells` from the top menu bar
